## Best way to contribute to STORfs

If you would like to contribute to STORfs as a maintainer, please reach out to me via [Email](matt001k@comcast.net).
Compiled library sizes would also be beneficial for having to document on different processor architectures, those can again be [emailed](matt001k@comcast.net) to me.
It would provide great benefit to have multiple people able to work on this project as a whole, that way updates and responsibility does not fall on the shoulders of just myself!

## Project Vision

Ideally I would like to get one or two other potential contributers to help along with this project for any issues that may arise.
Along with that, new feature requests to help improve the file system is almost a requirement as to continually improve this project.
Current planned items for future improvements will be available at the bottom of the README document within this repository as to give those that use it potential updates to the future of the project.
